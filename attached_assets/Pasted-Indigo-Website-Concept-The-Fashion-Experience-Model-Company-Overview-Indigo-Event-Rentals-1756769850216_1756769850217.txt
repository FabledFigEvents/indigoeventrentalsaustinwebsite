Indigo Website Concept — The Fashion Experience Model
Company Overview: 


“Indigo Event Rentals Austin” is a boutique event rental company that serves the Austin, TX market by providing comprehensive party and event rental services including chairs, tables, linens, table settings, wedding decorations, lighting, speakers, dance floors, and photo booths.

The company’s mission is to become a trusted partner for clients, event planners, and venues seeking professional, reliable rental equipment and full delivery, setup, teardown, and pickup services.

Website Details:
Overall Feel
Brand Concept: Indigo is not just an event rental company — it’s a fashion-inspired lifestyle brand. The website should feel like a fashion magazine meets luxury boutique, where browsing rentals feels like flipping through curated designer collections.


Vibe: Editorial, boutique, curated — like browsing a high-end fashion brand’s site, but for event rentals. 


Layout: Clean grid-based design, strong use of white space, full-width hero imagery, magazine-style typography.


Tone: Empowering, confident, and gender-inclusive.Focused on expression and experience.


UX: Fun to explore — browsing should feel more like shopping a fashion lookbook than checking boxes on a rental inventory list.


Note: The website should feature a robust “shopping cart” quote booking system that allows customers to build their desired order as they browse the site, and then a “checkout” page where they can see the estimated cost of the items they chose (where they can change quantity), the estimated delivery fee (based on their location), the estimated setup fees (based on what they’re ordering), and pricing for an optional damage waiver.
Visual Identity (quick summary)
Typography:


Headings: Bold serif (editorial, fashion-magazine feel).


Body: Minimalist sans serif.


1. Home
Hero Section
Background: Video loop or carousel of styled events if possible (a chic rooftop cocktail party, a romantic backyard wedding, a bold corporate gala) — each feels like a “collection drop.”  If that is too much for a first implementation, please include a full-width editorial photo (fashion-magazine styled event).


Headline: [I don’t know, please come up with something]


Hero section subcopy: “Every gathering deserves a signature look.”


CTAs: [Browse Collections] [Get a Quote]

2. “Product Catalog” (Inventory/Product Pages)
Format: Product catalog styled as a fashion boutique. Each category (Tables, Seating, Lighting) styled like fashion categories.


Each rental item shown like a product card: editorial photo, name, and style notes. High-quality, editorial-style product photography (clean backgrounds, styled settings).


Filters: Style, Color, Category, Popularity.


Copy that evokes style rather than function:


Instead of “60” Round Folding Table,” it’s: “The Circle — versatile and timeless, ideal for intimate gatherings or grand feasts.”


Products in this section can be added to the shopping cart 



3. “Designer Collections” (Packages and Bundles)
Event setups shown as curated collections, like seasonal fashion lines:


The Modern Minimalist (sleek tables, monochrome linens, solid-color chairs).


The Bohemian Luxe (wooden farm tables, vintage lounge seating, patterned rugs).


The Bold Statement (geometric arches, jewel-toned linens, dramatic lighting).
CTAs: [Style My Event With This Look].


Clicking into a collection feels like opening a fashion lookbook: styled photography, inspirational text, and easy “add to my event” functionality.
i.e. Collections in this section can be added to the customer’s shopping cart all at once by clicking “add to my event”” and specifying how many guests will be at their event, then the website will intelligently add the amount (or size for items like dance floors) of each item appropriately in order to accommodate the specified amount of guests.
4. “Lookbook” (Inspiration / Gallery)
Stylized event setups as if they were photographed for a fashion magazine spread.

Styled like a lookbook.

Fashion-magazine style editorial content. SEO + inspirational value



Notes for pages rebranded as a fashion term: Use the fashion label as the primary nav title.  Then add the practical term as a subtle subtitle/tooltip. This way, people feel like they’re stepping into a couture showroom, not a warehouse catalog, while still making sure SEO and usability are intact.
